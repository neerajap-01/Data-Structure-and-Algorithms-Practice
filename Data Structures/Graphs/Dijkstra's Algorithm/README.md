# Dijkstra's Algorithm

A brief description of Dijkstra's Algorithm in this readme file.


## Shortest Path Algorithms

When working with weighted and directed/undirected graphs, we very commonly want to know how to get from one vertex to another! Better yet, how to do it **quickly**.

**What's the fastest way to get from point A to point B?**
## OBJECTIVES

Understand the importance of **Dijkstra's**
Implement a Weighted Graph
Walk through the steps of **Dijkstra's**
Implement **Dijkstra's** using a naive priority queue
Implement **Dijkstra's** using a binary heap priority queue
## WHAT IS IT

One of the most famous and widely used algorithms around!

Finds the shortest path between two vertices on a graph

"What's the fastest way to get from point A to point B?"
## WHO WAS HE?

[Edsger Dijkstra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra) was a Dutch programmer, physicist, essayist, and all around smarty-pants

He helped to advance the field of computer science from an "art" to an academic discipline

Many of his discoveries and algorithms are still commonly used to this day.

## A QUOTE

What is the shortest way to travel from [Rotterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotterdam) to [Groningen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groningen), in general: from given city to given city. [It is the algorithm for the shortest path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem), which I designed in about twenty minutes. One morning I was shopping in [Amsterdam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amsterdam) with my young fiancée, and tired, we sat down on the café terrace to drink a cup of coffee and I was just thinking about whether I could do this, and I then designed the algorithm for the shortest path. As I said, it was a twenty-minute invention. Eventually that algorithm became, to my great amazement, one of the cornerstones of my fame.

— Edsger Dijkstra, in an interview with Philip L. Frana, Communications of the ACM, 2001[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm#cite_note-Dijkstra_Interview-2)
## WHY IS IT USEFUL?

- GPS - finding fastest route
- Network Routing - finds open shortest path for data
- Biology - used to model the spread of viruses among humans
- Airline tickets - finding cheapest route to your destination
- Many other uses!

## Let's Write A Weighted Graph

<<<<<<<IMG>>>>>>>

```
class WeightedGraph{
  constructor(){
    this.adjacencyList = {}
  }

  addVertex(vertex){
    if(!this.adjacencyList[vertex]) this.adjacencyList[vertex] = []
  }

  addEdge(vertex1,vertex2,weight){
    if(!this.adjacencyList.hasOwnProperty(vertex1)) this.addVertex(vertex1)
    if(!this.adjacencyList.hasOwnProperty(vertex2)) this.addVertex(vertex2)
    this.adjacencyList[vertex1].push({node: vertex2, weight})
    this.adjacencyList[vertex2].push({node: vertex1, weight})
  }
}
```
## THE APPROACH

- Every time we look to visit a new node, we pick the node with the smallest known distance to visit first.
- Once we’ve moved to the node we’re going to visit, we look at each of its neighbors
- For each neighboring node, we calculate the distance by summing the total edges that lead to the node we’re checking from the starting node.
- If the new total distance to a node is less than the previous total, we store the new shorter distance for that node.

## A simple PQ

```
class PriorityQueue {
  constructor(){
    this.values = [];
  }
  enqueue(val, priority) {
    this.values.push({val, priority});
    this.sort();
  };
  dequeue() {
    return this.values.shift();
  };
  sort() {
    this.values.sort((a, b) => a.priority - b.priority);
  };
}
```
***Notice we are sorting which is O(N * log(N))***

### Can we do better?

We sure can! Using a min binary heap

**Right now, let's focus on Dijkstra's**
## Dijkstra's Pseudocode

- This function should accept a starting and ending vertex
- Create an object (we'll call it distances) and set each key to be every vertex in the adjacency list with a value of infinity, except for the starting vertex which should have a value of 0.
- After setting a value in the distances object, add each vertex with a priority of Infinity to the priority queue, except the starting vertex, which should have a priority of 0 because that's where we begin.
- Create another object called previous and set each key to be every vertex in the adjacency list with a value of null
- Start looping as long as there is anything in the priority queue
  - dequeue a vertex from the priority queue
  - If that vertex is the same as the ending vertex - we are done!
  - Otherwise loop through each value in the adjacency list at that vertex
    - Calculate the distance to that vertex from the starting vertex
    - if the distance is less than what is currently stored in our distances object
      - update the distances object with new lower distance
      - update the previous object to contain that vertex
      - enqueue the vertex with the total distance from the start node
## Dijkshtra Solution

```
class PriorityQueue {
  constructor(){
    this.values = [];
  }
  enqueue(val, priority) {
    this.values.push({val, priority});
    this.sort();
  };
  dequeue() {
    return this.values.shift();
  };
  sort() {
    this.values.sort((a, b) => a.priority - b.priority);
  };
}

class WeightedGraph {
    constructor() {
        this.adjacencyList = {};
    }
    addVertex(vertex){
        if(!this.adjacencyList[vertex]) this.adjacencyList[vertex] = [];
    }
    addEdge(vertex1,vertex2, weight){
        this.adjacencyList[vertex1].push({node:vertex2,weight});
        this.adjacencyList[vertex2].push({node:vertex1, weight});
    }
    Dijkstra(start, finish){
        const nodes = new PriorityQueue();
        const distances = {};
        const previous = {};
        let path = [] //to return at end
        let smallest;
        //build up initial state
        for(let vertex in this.adjacencyList){
            if(vertex === start){
                distances[vertex] = 0;
                nodes.enqueue(vertex, 0);
            } else {
                distances[vertex] = Infinity;
                nodes.enqueue(vertex, Infinity);
            }
            previous[vertex] = null;
        }
        // as long as there is something to visit
        while(nodes.values.length){
            smallest = nodes.dequeue().val;
            if(smallest === finish){
                //WE ARE DONE
                //BUILD UP PATH TO RETURN AT END
                while(previous[smallest]){
                    path.push(smallest);
                    smallest = previous[smallest];
                }
                break;
            }

                for(let neighbor in this.adjacencyList[smallest]){
                    //find neighboring node
                    let nextNode = this.adjacencyList[smallest][neighbor];
                    //calculate new distance to neighboring node
                    let candidate = distances[smallest] + nextNode.weight;
                    let nextNeighbor = nextNode.node;
                    if(candidate < distances[nextNeighbor]){
                        //updating new smallest distance to neighbor
                        distances[nextNeighbor] = candidate;
                        //updating previous - How we got to neighbor
                        previous[nextNeighbor] = smallest;
                        //enqueue in priority queue with new priority
                        nodes.enqueue(nextNeighbor, candidate);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return path.concat(smallest).reverse();     
    }
}

var graph = new WeightedGraph()
graph.addVertex("A");
graph.addVertex("B");
graph.addVertex("C");
graph.addVertex("D");
graph.addVertex("E");
graph.addVertex("F");

graph.addEdge("A","B", 4);
graph.addEdge("A","C", 2);
graph.addEdge("B","E", 3);
graph.addEdge("C","D", 2);
graph.addEdge("C","F", 4);
graph.addEdge("D","E", 3);
graph.addEdge("D","F", 1);
graph.addEdge("E","F", 1);


graph.Dijkstra("A", "E");

// ["A", "C", "D", "F", "E"]
```
## Improving Dijkstra's

**Dijkstra's algorithm is greedy! That can cause problems!**

**We can improve this algorithm by adding a heuristics (a best guess)**

## Recap

- Graphs are collections of vertices connected by edges
- Graphs can be represented using adjacency lists, adjacency matrices and quite a few other forms.
- Graphs can contain weights and directions as well as cycles
- Just like trees, graphs can be traversed using BFS and DFS
- Shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra can be altered using a heuristic to achieve better results like those with A*
