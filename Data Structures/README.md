# DATA STRUCTURES

WE'VE HIT A
TURNING POINT IN THE COURSE

## WHAT DO THEY DO?

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data
## WHY SO MANY???

Different data structures excel at different things.  Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays) are more generally used.
## WHY CARE?

The more time you spend as a developer, the more likely you'll need to use one of these data structures

You've already worked with many of them unknowingly!

THERE IS NO ONE ***"BEST"*** DATA STRUCTURE

They all excel in different situations... \
Otherwise why bother learning them all??

**Working with map/location data?** \
==> Use a graph!

**Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end?** \
==> Use a linked list!

**Web scraping nested HTML?** \
==> Use a tree!

**Need to write a scheduler?** \
==> Use a binary heap!

## ES2015 CLASS SYNTAX

**Classes :-** \
Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data. Classes in JS are built on prototypes but also have some syntax and semantics that are not shared with ES5 class-like semantics.

**Defining classes :-** \
Classes are in fact "special functions", and just as you can define function expressions and function declarations, the class syntax has two components: class expressions and class declarations.
## OBJECTIVES

- Explain what a class is
- Understand how JavaScript implements the **idea** of classes
- Define terms like abstraction, encapsulation and polymorphism
- Use ES2015 classes to implement data structures
