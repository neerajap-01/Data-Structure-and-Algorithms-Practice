A brief description of ITERATION & RECURSION in this readme file.

## FIRST, STORY TIME

Once Upon A Time...

Their were a boy and dragon way befoe computers were invented and their were witches.

     üë¶                                       üê≤
    Martin                &                The Dragon

Martin got a task to find the odd numbers from the below list from dragon.

### 
```
Martin said,
Excuse me Mr. Dragon,

Are any of these numbers odd?
(3142 5798 6550 5914)

Dragon said,
ANGRY DRAGON!(üò°üê≤)

Sorry boy, I'll only tell you if the first number in that list is odd.

Martin said,
BUT I NEED TO KNOW IF ANY OF THE NUMBERS IN THE LIST ARE ODD!

Dragon said,
SORRY BOY, I'LL ONLY TELL YOU IF THE FIRST NUMBER IN A LIST IS ODD
```
After thinking for some time,ü§î

```
Martin replied,
Ok fine, what about the first number in this list?

(|| 3142 || 5798 6550 5914)

        NOT ODD! - dragon said

And what about the first number in this other list?

(|| 5798 || 6550 5914)

      NOT ODD! - dragon said

Ok fine, what about the first number in this list?

(|| 6550 || 5914)

    NOT ODD! - dragon said

Ok fine, what about the first number in this list?

(|| 5914 ||)

  NOT ODD! - dragon said

Ok fine, what about the first number in this list?

( )

Dragon said,
That's an empty list you moron! There isn't a number in there!
```

**AHA! So all the numbers are even in that list!** - Martain replied

Explanation:- 
```
No odds (3142 5798 6550 5914)

     No odds (5798 6550 5914)

          No odds (6550 5914)

               No odds (5914)

                   No odds ()
```

**Congratulations, you discovered recursion.**

## What is recursion?

A **process** (a function in our case) that **calls itself**
## Why do I need to know this?

### It's EVERYWHERE!

- JSON.parse / JSON.stringify
- document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms
- Object traversal
- Very common with more complex algorithms
- It's sometimes a cleaner alternative to iteration

# How recursive functions work
Invoke the **same** function with a different input until you reach your base case!


## Two essential parts of a recursive function!
- Base Case
- Different Input

### Base Case
The condition when the recursion ends.

**This is the most important concept to understand**

### Our first recursive function

```
function countDown(num){
    if(num <= 0) {
        console.log("All done!");
        return;
    }
    console.log(num);
    num--;
    countDown(num);
}
```

### Our second recursive function

```
function sumRange(num){
   if(num === 1) return 1; 
   return num + sumRange(num-1);
}
```
**Can you spot the base case?** \
**Do you notice the different input?** \
**What would happen if we didn't return?**

## The ALL important `return` keyword
```
function sumRange(num){
   if(num === 1) return 1; 
   return num + sumRange(num-1);
}
```
Let's break this down step by step!

### sumRange with the call stack
```
function sumRange(num){
   if(num === 1) return 1; 
   return num + sumRange(num-1);
}

sumRange(5)
```

## Another example

```
function factorial(num){
    if(num === 1) return 1;
    return num * factorial(num-1);
}
```
Let's visualize the call stack!
## Visualizing a recursive function with the Chrome Dev Tools

### Where things go wrong

- No base case
- Forgetting to return or returning the wrong thing!
- Stack overflow! 

```
function factorial(num){
    if(num === 1) return 1;
    return num * factorial(num);
}
```
```
function factorial(num){
    if(num === 1) console.log(1) ;
    return num * factorial(num-1);
}
```
## HELPER METHOD RECURSION

```
function outer(input){
    
    var outerScopedVariable = []

    function helper(helperInput){
        // modify the outerScopedVariable
        helper(helperInput--)
    }
    
    helper(input)

    return outerScopedVariable;

}
```

### ANOTHER EXAMPLE
Let's try to collect all of the odd values in an array!

```
function collectOddValues(arr){
    
    let result = []

    function helper(helperInput){
        if(helperInput.length === 0) {
            return;
        }
        
        if(helperInput[0] % 2 !== 0){
            result.push(helperInput[0])
        }
        
        helper(helperInput.slice(1))
    }
    
    helper(arr)

    return result;
}
```
## PURE RECURSION
```
function collectOddValues(arr){
    let newArr = [];
    
    if(arr.length === 0) {
        return newArr;
    }
        
    if(arr[0] % 2 !== 0){
        newArr.push(arr[0]);
    }
        
    newArr = newArr.concat(collectOddValues(arr.slice(1)));
    return newArr;
}
```
## Pure Recursion Tips

- For arrays, use methods like **slice, the spread operator,** and **concat** that make copies of arrays so you do not mutate them
- Remember that strings are immutable so you will need to use methods like **slice, substr, or substring** to make copies of strings
- To make copies of objects use **Object.assign, or the spread operator**
## What about big O?

Measuring time complexity is relatively simple. You can measure the **time complexity** of a recursive function as then number of recursive calls you need to make relative to the input
Measuring space complexity is a bit more challenging. You can measure the **space complexity** of a recursive function as the **maximum** number of functions on the call stack at a given time, since the call stack requires memory.
## RECURSION PROBLEM SET

### 1. POWER

Write a function which accepts a base an an exponent.  It should return the result of raising the base to that exponent.
```
power(2,4) //16
power(3,2) //9
power(3,3) //27
```

### HINT!

### 2. productOfArray
Write a function called productOfArray which takes in an array of numbers and returns the product of them all.
```
productOfArray([1,2,3])    // 6
productOfArray([1,2,3,10]) // 60
```
## Tail Call Optimization

- ES2015 allows for tail call optimization, where you can make some function calls without growing the call stack.

- By using the **return** keyword in a specific fashion we can extract output from a function without keeping it on the call stack.

- Unfortunately this has not been implemented across multiple browsers so it is not reasonable to implement in production code. 
## Recap

- A recursive function is a function that invokes itself
- Your recursive functions should **always** have a base case and be invoked with different input each time
- When using recursion, it's often essential to return values from one function to another to extract data from each function call
- Helper method recursion is an alternative that allows us to use an external scope in our recursive functions
- Pure recursion eliminates the need for helper method recursion, but can be trickier to understand at first
