# Algorithms and Problem Solving Patterns

A brief on how to solve a particular DSA problems.


## OBJECTIVES

- Define what an algorithm is
- Devise a plan to solve algorithms
- Compare and contrast problem solving patterns including frequency counters, two pointer problems and divide and conquer
## WHAT IS AN ALGORITHM?

A **process** or **set of steps** to accomplish a certain task.
## Why do I need to know this?


Almost **everything** that you do in programming involves some kind of **algorithm!**

**It's the foundation for being a successful problem solving and developer**
                                
### also for **INTERVIEWS*** 



## PROBLEM SOLVING

- **Understand the Problem**
- **Explore Concrete Examples**
- **Break It Down**
- **Solve/Simplify**
- **Look Back and Refactor**
